A prototype iOS application to allow visitors to draw their pain levels.

## TODO:

* ~~Setup project and get JotUI running~~. (3hrs)

* Have that web server generate a slideshow.
* Create custom brush textures.
* Augment the images.

Total time so far: 3hrs.

## Server

A [backend server](https://github.com/MODatUniSA/mod-image-server) will accept the drawings, and play a slideshow of the images.
