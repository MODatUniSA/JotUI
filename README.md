# MOD. Draw Your Pain

A prototype iOS application to allow visitors to draw their pain levels.

## TODO:

* ~~Setup project and get JotUI running~~. (3hrs)
* ~~Post the image created to a web server.~~
* ~~Have that web server generate a slideshow.~~
* ~~Augment the images.~~
* ~~Add an undo/redo button.~~
* ~~Make the interface a bit prettier.~~
* Create custom brush textures.

## Servers

A [backend server](https://github.com/MODatUniSA/mod-image-server) will accept the drawings, and play a slideshow of the images.

A [style transfer server](https://github.com/MODatUniSA/mod-fast-style-transfer) to augment the images using CNN style transfer.
